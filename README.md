#Song Picker Code Sample
  
Hi LeadPages!  This is my code sample package.  It's a song picking
utility, for choosing a list of songs that within a certain total
duration.  For instance, if you go to the gym for an hour every day,
and want a different 60 minute playlist every time, this is
the tool for you!
  
##Installation:
I usually use pip + virtualenv for managing my installs.  Thus, you will find
a requirements.txt file, which you can use with `pip -r` to install
my dependencies!  Afterwords, just run  
`pip install file://<absolute path to package source>`  
  
##Resources:
This package includes two files:
1. song_picker.py:  A module containing the song-picking-library-goodies
2. pick-songs: A command line utility for picking songs
